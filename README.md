# BlackArch-Projects
Some projects done to help refine Cybersecurity Knowledge. 
This repository is something I will personally use for projects to help build experience and actually use my home lab for more than networking experiments.
All files in this repository were used on a home lab purely for experimentation. The "malware" files are pretty much dummy files with links to "evil" and sites similar to that, which allows for them to be detected using defensive scripts.

## Personal Use
I went through the liberty of creating files explaining the usage of these files and detailing how they worked. I made sure to include little comments offering very short explanations as to what is being written in the script. I spit out some explanatory MD files that go much deeper into the explanations. It talks about strings, imports, why I used certain explicit lines of code, amongst other things! I suggest reading those if you have no idea what you're looking at or why things are coded in the way that they are. I also suggest trying to build upon these scripts, as they are beginner friendly and simple when understood!

## "IT DOESN'T WORK!!!"
If you're splititng these projects up into different folders, I suggest you copy the implant.bin you created using gcc (see Implant and Extraction Project) into the other project folders. The scripts here are simple and scan current directories because I never gave them explicit permissions to read throughout the entire machine. As long as there is an implant.bin file in the directory, the projects should work as intended!

## I'M STILL NEW TO THIS!!!
I am still relatively new to this. None of these projects were done in a college environment. Most of my courses in CST so far have been related to infrastructure and networking, vulnerability exploitation, and database administration. I just... can't wait though, so I went online and started looking at some project ideas that I could do on my own in the meantime.
